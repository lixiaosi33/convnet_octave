## Convolutional neural networks implemented in octave

Tested on http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ handwritten digits dataset with 98% accuracy. Paste this dataset in common folder before running.

### Running
	octave cnnTrain.m

## Todo
	* Add support for gpu acceleration
	* Add support for dynamically specifying architecture
